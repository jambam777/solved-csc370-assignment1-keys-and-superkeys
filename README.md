<strong>Question 1</strong>: Keys and Superkeys

Consider a relation <em>Q </em>on atomic attributes (<em>A,B,C,D,E</em>) and the following functional dependencies.

BC → A

ABD → CE CD → A

<ul>

 <li>List all of the superkeys of <em>Q</em>.</li>

 <li>List all of the candidate keys of <em>Q</em>.</li>

 <li>Give <strong>one </strong>new functional dependency of the form <em>X </em>→ <em>Y </em>(with one attribute on each side) such that if your new dependency were added to the list above, the relation <em>Q </em>would have only one candidate key.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Question 2</strong>: Closures and Functional Dependencies

Consider a relation <em>R </em>on atomic attributes (<em>A,B,C,D,E,F</em>) and the following functional dependencies.

AB → C

CD → BF AE → C

AD → E

<ul>

 <li>What is the closure of {<em>A,B,E</em>}?</li>

 <li>The relation <em>R </em>has only one candidate key. What is it?</li>

 <li>What is the highest normal form attained by the relation <em>R </em>under the dependencies above? Choose from 1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF. Justify your answer; answers with no justification will receive no marks.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Question 3</strong>: Normal Forms

Consider a relation <em>S </em>on atomic attributes (<em>A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H</em>) and the following functional dependencies.

1

ACG → B

B → G C → D G → A

DE → GC

H               → EF

DEF → H

<ul>

 <li>List all of the FDs above that are 3NF violations.</li>

</ul>

List all of the FDs above that are BCNF violations. This list will include all of the FDs from part (a), since a 3NF violation is automatically also a BCNF violation
